"Hello! I'm daviddiandru"
A self-taught student of web and app development, well, for now only web...ðŸ˜‚
This is a short description about my proyects & on my hard path to be a great developer.

## Content
This proyect has three branches: HTML, JS & CSS. **HTML's** They contain the texts that I learn every day on different sites and YouTube channels, such as Platzy, Dalto, and other developers that inspire me  **JS's**  It contains the javascript files of the projects that I have followed and learned ... later you will see some of mine ðŸ˜Š.  **CSS** Finally css contains all the styles and some very good tricks when decorating and customizing your projects. Of course they are not the best or the most professional, but they are very cool ... by the way the projects are not finished, I am modifying them as I learn more beautiful things
